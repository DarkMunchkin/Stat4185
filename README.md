# Stat4185 Final Project

Objective Statement:
This project aims to analyze the trends, popularity, and critical reception of Sony PlayStation exclusive games. The goal is to understand how these exclusives have influenced the brand's success and their overall impact in the gaming industry.
Data Collection:
Data will be sourced from Metacritic, IGN, and Sony's official reports. It will include game titles, release dates, genres, user and critic ratings, and sales figures. Efforts will be made to ensure a comprehensive dataset covering a significant timespan.
Data Cleaning:
Python's pandas library will be used to clean and preprocess the data. This includes handling missing values, normalizing data formats, and ensuring data accuracy and reliability.
Data Visualization:
Visualizations will be created using Python's matplotlib and seaborn libraries. These will include line graphs, bar charts, and scatter plots to depict trends over time, genre popularity, and the relationship between ratings and sales. All visualizations will have clearly labeled axes and titles.
Data Modeling and Analysis:
The project will primarily focus on exploratory data analysis. Basic statistical models may be used to analyze relationships between different variables, such as ratings and sales. The aim is to gain insights into the performance and reception of PlayStation exclusives.
Submission and Documentation:
The project will be documented through a series of Jupyter notebooks with accompanying code and explanations. A final write-up summarizing the findings and conclusions will be included. All materials will be hosted on a GitHub repository.

This proposal adheres to the guidelines of the course and aims to use data science tools to provide meaningful insights into the gaming industry, focusing on Sony PlayStation exclusives. It demonstrates the application of data collection, cleaning, visualization, and analysis techniques.
